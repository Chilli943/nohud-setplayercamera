# MP2's Camera Include

This is merely a GitHub repost of SetPlayerCamera (without the HUD) v2.1 by [MP2](http://forum.sa-mp.com/member.php?u=115788) because it does not exist on GitHub making package management with sampctl difficult.

The original topic and documentation [is here](http://forum.sa-mp.com/showthread.php?p=2362690).

@MP2: If you want to host this on your own account, open an issue and I will delete this repository.

## Installation

Simply install to your project:

```bash
sampctl package install Chilli943/nohud-setplayercamera
```

Include in your code and begin using the library:

```pawn
#include <camera>
```

## Usage

For usage documentation, please see the original post linked above.
